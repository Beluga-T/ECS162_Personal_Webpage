                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm a passionate and highly motivated undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of
                    Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. My academic journey is fueled by
                    an insatiable curiosity for technology and its power to transform lives. With a solid foundation in
                    programming, data structures, and algorithms, I've also dipped my toes into the fascinating world of
                    research, exploring the limitless possibilities within the realms of software development, machine
                    learning, and data science.
                </p>

                <h2>My Interest</h2>
                <p>
                    Away from the screen, my passion shifts to capturing the beauty of the world through the lens of my
                    camera. Photography allows me to preserve fleeting moments, from the subtle interplay of light and
                    shadow to the grandeur of landscapes. It's a pursuit that challenges my creativity and sharpens my
                    perspective, encouraging me to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Complementing my love for photography is my enthusiasm for travel. Journeying to new destinations is
                    not
                    just about the change of scenery, but about the stories to tell and the experiences to cherish.
                    Whether
                    it's a road trip a few hours from home or an adventure across continents, each trip is a chapter in
                    my
                    life's narrative, filled with lessons and memories.
