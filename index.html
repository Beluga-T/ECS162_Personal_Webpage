            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                Hello there! I'm a passionate and highly motivated undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of
                Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. My academic journey is fueled by
                an insatiable curiosity for technology and its power to transform lives. With a solid foundation in
                programming, data structures, and algorithms, I've also dipped my toes into the fascinating world of
                research, exploring the limitless possibilities within the realms of software development, machine
                learning, and data science.

            <h2>My Interest</h2>
            <p>
                What drives me is not just the pursuit of knowledge but the desire to apply what I learn in
                meaningful ways. Whether it's developing innovative software solutions, unraveling complex data
                patterns, or contributing to groundbreaking machine learning projects, I'm always on the lookout for
                opportunities to push the boundaries of what I know and expand my skills.

                Outside the digital world, you'll find me exploring nature, reading about the latest tech trends, or
                experimenting with new coding projects. I'm on a constant quest to grow, learn, and make a positive
                impact through technology.
