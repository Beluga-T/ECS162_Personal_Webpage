        Me_animate.png is created through DALLE by asking to create a animated version of myself. 
        the myfriend_lake_tahoe_surise.png is shot by myself last year when I visited Lake Tahoe with my friend.
        I have web development experienced before, but its been long time.
        The most difficult is the Javascript part, I refreshed my memeroy of how to listen to the scroll event to show animation of each 
        section to slide in and slide out when it should be shown by asking GPT. and I'm proud of solving the responsive design problem  
        by using flex property and dynamic width for the sections to make it look good on different screen size.

        My design of choice is to a minimalism Apple style format, so i use rounded corner and shadow to make each section look like a card.
        And also I use the green and purple color with glow effect based on github Welcome page to make it look more modern and cool.

        When it comes to the content, I want to show my passion for computer science and my interest in traveling and my publication and github.

                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm a passionate and highly motivated undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of
                    Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. My academic journey is fueled by
                    an insatiable curiosity for technology and its power to transform lives. With a solid foundation in
                    programming, data structures, and algorithms, I've also dipped my toes into the fascinating world of
                    research, exploring the limitless possibilities within the realms of software development, machine
                    learning, and data science.

                <p>
                    Beyond the confines of computer science, traveling gives me the freedom to disconnect from daily
                    routines and immerse myself in new experiences. One of my most memorable trips was to Lake Tahoe,
                    where the serene beauty of the lake and the ruggedness of the surrounding mountains offered a
                    perfect escape from the digital world.

                <p>
                    Whether it's hiking through the Sierra Nevada or kayaking on the crystal-clear waters of Lake Tahoe,
                    each adventure is a chance to create lasting memories with friends and learn more about the world.
                    These experiences are not just escapes but also crucial moments of inspiration. AI might be able to
                    generate realistic image of beautiful view, but not the memory of the trip with my friends.
